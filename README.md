# address-book
an address book of my classmates. each one is printed as an ID card!

## how to use
open the AdressBook.py file and run it in a python interpreter.

## Why does this branch exist?
This branch contains a better version of the program. The teacher wouldn't let me submit it because he didn't teach the class how to use lists.
